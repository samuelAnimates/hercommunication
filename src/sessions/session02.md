### Intro
The main goal of this class is to work with the aspects of health communication that go beyond the transfer of information. And we'll aim to have fun while doing so. The learning objectives for todays session are:
- Use art to examine the kinds of things that public health communication could do more
- Think about some of the strengths art has as a means of communication

### Community Standards (5 minutes)
If it helps to set the mood, you  can imagine we're here together at Court Theatre at University of Chicago. If you listen carefully, you can hear the beach, but maybe not because of Zoom audio filters.

Here are a few community standards for this weird online beach:
 - **W.A.I.T.** means "Why am I talking?" and "Why aren't I talking?" We're all here as a group, and we'll benefit the most if people get an equal shot at sharing their ideas. If you find yourself speaking up a lot, stop and **W.A.I.T.** If you find yourslef not speaking up much, stop and **W.A.I.T.** as reminder to switch things up.
 - Don't assume what pronouns someone uses. We'll introduce ourselves with our pronouns. If you forget, then ask. Feel free to rename yourself on Zoom to include your pronouns. I will not be afraid to jump in if someone makes a mistake, and I invite everyone else to remind people if they need it as well.
 - Do not record, screencap, or otherwise share other people's stories from this class. We'll talk about health topics, and people might bring up their own experiences. We want to honor that openness with respect for privacy.
 - I will not record any part of this lecture. That said, we will make things together, and I'll ask explicitly if it's okay to put some of this class's outputs online without using any names.

### Warm-up (5 minutes)
For our warm-up, we'll share our name, pronouns, and some piece of art that has made us feel literally anything recently. Happy, sad, frustrated, bored, hungry, whatever feeling. Pop song, TV, movie, book, game, photo, whatever art. Then we'll call on the next person until everyone has had a chance. I'll start first:
 - Name
 - Pronouns
 - A piece of art
 - How it made you feel
 - Call on the next person

### Opening Song (5 minutes)
I'm going to add one more piece to this discussion. That way we have at least one common reference point. Though feel free to refer back to the piece of art you mentioned earlier. We will listen to a song called "[June Gloom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaLW9jk3748)" by Allie X.

### Brainstorm (10 minutes)
Reflection from Sam: "I first saw that lyric video in May 2020, but I knew the song came out on an album several months earlier. I was fascinated because it really seemed to capture a lot of feelings I had when COVID-19 precautions started bleeding into the spring and summer. It was so oddly comforting for me to know that someone had felt this way before. Judging by some comments and reactions, it seemed like other people shared that sentiment. I was curious, so I looked up the song's backstory and it turns out it was inspired by the artist's experience with an autoimmune condition, spending teenage summers in her room because she couldn't go anywhere."

From this reflection we can see a few impacts that art and artists can have:
- Bring together an audience
- Comfort people
- Share personal experiences

Now we're going to take a few minutes for a group brainstorm to add more things to this list.

### Poetry Step 1 (2 minutes)
Now we're going to take a page out of Augusto Boal's book with a poetry exercise, with some tweaks to make it more collaborative and more related to health communication. Before we start, know that you do not need any writing experience for this activity. You don't even need to feel creative. You also will not finish your poem and you will not have to read what you wrote for other people.

Step 1 is to fill in the blank of this sentence to make the title of your poem: I Feel Healthy When I (BLANK).

### Poetry Step 2 (2 minutes)
Step 2 is to write a poem related to what you wrote in your title. It does not need to feel creative or insightful or beautiful. You can write descriptions of feelings. You can write descriptions of things. You can write descriptions of places. Each line just has to be shorter than the width of the page. It needs to fit on one page. It needs to have at least 4 lines.

### Poetry Step 3 (2 minutes)
Step 3 is to delete every article ("a," "an," "the"), every word that ends in the letter "y," and every word longer than 2 syllables in your poem. Just delete. Do not add.

### Poetry Step 4 (5 minutes)
Step 4 is to swap poems so you can edit someone else's. Then you will first reword and restructure so that there are at least 2 pairs of lines that rhyme. Then you will cut words (or add words) so the first and last line are 3 words long.

### Interlude (10 minutes)
We'll look at the comic "[Hurricane Maria's Real Toll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaLW9jk3748)" and revisit our list from earlier.

### Reading and Closing Thoughts (15 minutes)
Finally, I'll read aloud all the poems from today and we can share some closing thoughts about the learning objectives.
